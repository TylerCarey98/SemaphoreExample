# How to Github
For those who have not used github before please follow these guidlines when working on this project.
  1. Never commit to master.
  2. Always make a branch when working on a part of the project.
  3. Merge that branch to develop.
Typically you would have someone approve your PR (pull request) however given that this is such a small project I don't feel that this is neccesary. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

For this project please let someone know if you have a current branch working. Always make sure that you are working on the current version of develop.
